<h3>Abstract</h3>

The goal of this project is to stylize an inputted image to appear like a cartoon image. To accomplish this, we will detect the prominent shapes within the image and add an outline to them, as well as normalize the color groups of the image, narrowing each object to a pallet of a predetermined amount of colors. Additionally, we will apply minimal edge outlines within the image to make the primary textures more prominent.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Motivation behind the problem you are solving, what applications it has, any brief background on the particular domain you are working in (if not regular RBG photographs), etc. If you are using a new way to solve an existing problem, briefly mention and describe the existing approaches and tell us how your approach is new.

<br><br>
<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
<h5>Normalizing Colors</h5>
Our approach for altering the colors will include normalizing the color pallet using hue saturation and grouping shade colors together. To normalize the pallet, we will choose a predefined set of colors that generalizes only a few colors to each object. This choice will be made using hue saturation techniques. We will then group together these colors by the objects they belong to in order to reduce the amount of color variation across the image. 
 
<h5>Reinforcing Outlines</h5>
In order to create a hard outline of objects within the object, such as in a cartoon styled image, we will smooth and reinforce the outlines of objects within the images. We will smooth the outlines to be straighter and more defined to reduce excessive corners and line complexity. The techniques used in this will be Canny Edge Detection to first find the object lines and thresholding to detect and increase the thresholds of the images to a larger pixel value. 
 
<h5>Smooth Textures</h5>
To recreate the textures of a cartoon, we will detect highly textured areas within the images and either replace those selected texture patterns with a reduced image bank of smoother textures or apply a median filter to blur the image slightly to reduce the textures. Our team will decide on the final technique utilized here through experimentation on the image to test for best results.

<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Not yet gathered
<!--Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?-->
